This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a static site, dynamic sites and full-stack application from scratch on Workers. You may prefer to build your website from scratch if:

- You're interested in learning by implementing core functionalities on your own.
- You're working on a simple project where a framework might be overkill.
- You want to optimize for performance by minimizing external dependencies.
- You require complete control over every aspect of the application.

Alternativley, you use can a number of popular frameworks(LINK) that come with ready-to-use components, a pre-defined structured architecture, and community support. View framework specific guides(LINK) to get started using a framework.

# Deploying a Static Site

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a static site on Workers.

### 1. Create a new Worker project using the CLI

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare. Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-static-site --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Static Site",
		three: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

### 3. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Routing

Assets are served based on file based routing. Learn more about [assets routing configuration and defaults](/workers/frameworks/configuration/).

# Deploying a Dynamic Site

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a dynamic site, including websites using server-side rendering (SSR).

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

### 1. Create a new Worker project

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-dynamic-site --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Dynamic Site",
		three: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

## 3. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Routing

When serving assets, dynamic sites also follow file based routing. If a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, instead of serving a 404 response, the request will be handled by the server-side code in your Worker. Learn more about [assets routing configuration and defaults](/workers/frameworks/configuration/).

# Deploying a full-stack application

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a full stack application that queries data from [D1](/d1).

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

### 1. Create a new Worker project

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-fullstack-site --experimental"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Dynamic Site",
		three: "TypeScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Create your D1 database

In this step, you will set up your D1 local and remote(production) database via the `wrangler` CLI.

a. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create my-fullstack-site-db
```

b. Bind the database to your Worker by adding the resulting wrangler output to your project's `wrangler.toml` file. For example:

```
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "my-fullstack-site-db"
database_id = "__YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID__"
```

c. Create a table and add some sample data

Create a users table

```
wrangler d1 execute my-fullstack-site-db \
 --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users ( user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, email_address TEXT, created_at INTEGER, deleted INTEGER);"
```

Add some entries to the users table

```
wrangler d1 execute my-fullstack-site-db \
 --command "INSERT INTO users (email_address, deleted) VALUES('alice@example.com', FALSE),('bob@example.com', TRUE),('carol@example.com', FALSE),('dave@example.com', TRUE),('eve@example.com', FALSE);"
```

### 3. Develop locally

D1 has fully-featured support for local development, refer to [D1 local development](/d1/build-with-d1/local-development/) to learn about how to configure your database for local development.

Run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

## 4. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Routing

When serving assets, full-stack sites also follow file based routing. If a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, instead of serving a 404 response, the request will be handled by the server-side code in your Worker. Learn more about [assets routing configuration and defaults](/workers/frameworks/configuration/).

Projects with assets can be created and edited using the [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/) or by connecting to your Worker to a Git provider[link to CI docs]. You cannot upload or edit a Worker with assets through the Cloudflare dashboard.
