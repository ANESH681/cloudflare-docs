description: Create a Worker with assets throught the wrangler CLI or through a Git integration.

Projects with assets can be created and edited using the [Wrangler CLI](/workers/wrangler/) or by connecting to your Worker to a Git provider[link to CI docs]. You cannot upload or edit a Worker with assets through the Cloudflare dashboard.

# Deploying a Static Site

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a static site on Workers.

## Create using the CLI

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

### 1. Create a new Worker project

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={("my-static-site", "experimental")}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Worker with Assets",
		three: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

### 3. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Routing

Assets are served based on file based routing. Navigate to `my-static-site.<SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`, in order serve the `index.html` file in your root directory. If a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, Clouflare will respond with a 404.

# Deploying a Dynamic Site

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying a dynamic site, including websites with server-side rendered (SSR) content or full stack applications on Workers.

[C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

### 1. Create a new Worker project

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-dynamic-site"}
/>

<Render
	file="c3-post-run-steps"
	product="workers"
	params={{
		one: "Hello World example",
		two: "Hello World Dynamic Website",
		three: "JavaScript",
	}}
/>

### 2. Develop locally

After you have created your Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to preview your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

## 3. Deploy your Project

Deploy your Worker via Wrangler to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or configure a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

#### Routing

Similar to static sites, when serving assets, dynamic sites also follow file based routing. If a request is made to a path that does not match a file in your directory, instead of serving a 404 response, the request will be handled by the server-side code in your Worker.
